First the project was run for 100 ticks 5000 humans 50 zombies per patch. In a 2x2 configuration.
With scalasca, the execution time was:
Scalasca output: image1.png
Conclusions:

Most of the time is spent in a sincronization step and in agent action processing.
The sincronization part consists of MPI Messaging
The agent processing consists mainly of:

relogo/WorldCreator.h - createWorld function 8/80s
	There are some loops that I may be able to parallelize.
	
relogo/agentSet.h - minOneOf function 600/1200s
	Most of the time is spent executing the function received by argument.
	This function is usualy CountZombiesOnPatch.
	This function calls relogo/Observer.h turtlesOn
	
	
relogo/Observer.h - turtlesOn
	The second version of this function has a cicle that may be good to parallelize.
