To execute the code.
1- gcc 4.8: module load gcc/4.8
2- load scalasca: module load scalasca
3- Follow the repast guidelines to install the dependencies and compile the source files.
4- Use the Makefile for the execution binary. And the makefile-scalasca for the profiling binary
5- Inside the ext/bin/configs are some files for different problem sizes. to run them there are shell scripts inside the ext/bin folder.
For example the data_collection_160k.sh runs the simulation for a problem size of 160k zombies in different MPI configrations (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 4x8 for example) alternatively, run them individually with mpirun.
